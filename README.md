#   XTL-Extractor

This script iterates through all .zip files in the current working directory and will check if the 'evaluation.json' file for the respective .zip file has a mould value higher than a specified value. If it does, then it will then extract the respective 'EQ.xtl' file to a directorycalled 'XTL files meeting criteria'

'Example Test' folder has 6 example files which the script is intended to work on.
